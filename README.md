# Lutris Script - Spongebob Squarepants: The movie (PC)
This Repository contains a Lutris installation Script for Spongebob Squarepants: The Movie for PC (Windows).   
This Script does **only** work with the **German retail version**.

## About the script
The script looks for the "setup.exe" on a inserted disc.   
If Lutris does not find your disc, you can select the directory containing the "setup.exe" manually.   
Since the gameÂ´s setup is an "Installshield"-setup, I had to generate an "answer file" that the setup can use to obtain the desired settings.   
The script writes my previously generated answer file into the path "C:\setup.iss" in your wine prefix and finally references to it in an argument when running the setup executable.   

If you would like to generate a answer file youself, you can do ith with the following command:

``` 
path\to\setup.exe /r
```
